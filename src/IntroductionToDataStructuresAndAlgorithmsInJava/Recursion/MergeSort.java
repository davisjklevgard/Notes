        Merge sort
            a sorting algorithm that merges two arrays and sorts them at the same time.
            first would be to compare the first numbers of each array. WWhichever is smaller goes first into the new
            array and then the other first number is compared to the next number is the opposite array. This continues
            till there is a combined sorted array

            the method first takes an array and breaks apart the array into two separate parts, then will break apart
            those two arrays until they are sorted in arrays of one element each, then the algorithm will repeat the
            merge of those arrays before combining them together and so on till there is one full array
