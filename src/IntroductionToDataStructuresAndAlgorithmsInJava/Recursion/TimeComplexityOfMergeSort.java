    /*
        In merge sort, the array is broken down into individual parts and layers. So to find the time complexity
        one would count how many elements are in the array (making that N) and they would find the height or how many
        layers there are (make that H).
        n = 2^(h-1)
        h = 1 + log base 2 of n
        or it is O(n * log base 2 of n)


        So merge sort is great for time, but if there is a small amount of items then it is too slow
