        A heap can be implemented by just creating a binary tree.

        Another way
            made as an array as an underlying data structure.
        Why it works
            becaue each node is implemented in a sequence
        Relationship between parent and child
            parent = i
            left child = 2i+1
            right = 2i+2
        Using this, it is easy to create an array by just using the numbers that the nodes would represent.
