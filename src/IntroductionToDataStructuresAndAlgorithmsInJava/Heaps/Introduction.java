            A binary tree with special properties
                Complete
                    filled in when reading left to right across each row
                    last row may not be completely full
                    helps tree remain balance
                    This is done by having the nodes put in with a particular sequence
                        A complete tree must have a node added at the leftmost node, then the right child of the parent
                        node must be added going down the line
                        Cannot jump and add a new node without going through the sequence
                Every node's key (data contained within the node) is larger than (or equal to) the key of its children
        Ex:
            Scheduling Events in time
