    /*
        Open Addressing
            Another way to resolve collisions
            used when one does not want a link to a list or not allowed to read the data of any other element in the list
            the records are directly inserted in the array
            probes whether or not a slot in the array is already used or not

            Requires number of keys are less than the table size, Because table may fill up

            Issue
                Deleting a record is not very straightforward
            Trick
                mark as deleted and not truly delete
