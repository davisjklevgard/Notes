        Hash Tables
            Data structure created for very fast insertion and retrieval data
            happens in almost constant time
            has keys and values
            Keys
                can be any type of object
            Values
                can also be any type of object
                corresponds to a key
                Known as satellite data
            ex: A bakery website with pics of goods, and a list of description with each picture
                a list of users with email address as key and description of user as value
        Added data structure
            another data structure that gives constant time for insertion and retrieval
            use this data structure as the underlying one
            indexes used though are only integers
