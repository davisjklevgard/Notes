        Deleting an item can be more complicated compared to the other operations for binary search trees

        First to to is to find the node

        Three Cases to determine how the procedure follows
            Case 1: Node to be deleted is aa leaf
            Case 2: Node has one child
            Case 3: Node has two children

        For Case 1
            very easy to delete a leaf
            all that is needed to be done is to make the left or right side of the parent node set to null.
            make sure that you have the reference to the parent node or it will not be possible for deletion
