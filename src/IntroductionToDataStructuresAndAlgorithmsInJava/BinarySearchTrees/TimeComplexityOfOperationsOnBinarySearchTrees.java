        Search = O(log base 2 of n)
        Deleting = O(log base 2 of n)
        Inserting = O(log base 2 of n)

        This shows that each operation is incredibly fast and takes the same amount of time to complete. what this means
        then is that using this data structure will make it faster to store and access data than in other structures, at
        least for more complex storage.
