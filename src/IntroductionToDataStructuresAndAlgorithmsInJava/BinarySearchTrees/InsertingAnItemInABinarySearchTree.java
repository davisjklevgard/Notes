public class InsertingAnItemInABinarySearchTree {
    /*
        You compare what you are inserting first with the root node. As with searching, if it is lower go to the left,
        higher go to the right. You repeat this till you reach a part of the tree that does not have any children
        With that you make a child, right or left, of that data you wish to insert.

        Putting all the methods leads to errors. I believe it is because I had switched things around with the class
        names. Not sure how to fix this but might have to make my own examples at a later date. The other possibility I
        can think of is that Java has undergone minute changes since these videos and what I wish to implement needs
        other code.
