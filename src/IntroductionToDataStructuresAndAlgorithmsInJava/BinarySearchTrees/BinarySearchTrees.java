         Binary Search Tree
            a binary tree with a special property: any node to the left of the parent has a value less than that of the
                parent. the Right will have all values greater than the parent child

        Real World Examples
        Binary Search Tree - Used in many search applications where data is constantly entering/leaving, such as the map
                and set objects in many languages' libraries.
        Binary Space Partition - Used in almost every 3D video game to determine what objects need to be rendered.
        Binary Tries - Used in almost every high-bandwidth router for storing router-tables.
