    If a list of data is given and it is done so in ascending order, the tree will become unbalanced, like a vine, only
    going  one way down
    It would be a linked list essentially
    The operations used before work well on a balanced tree, with data on both sides, looking symmetrical

    Different tree (not discussed): AVL trees, red-black trees, and B-trees.
