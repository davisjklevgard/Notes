        The delete operation for the third case is rather complicated, so it is not used in a practical use
        Instead, a soft delete is used. This mean that instead of deleting, a node is marked as deleted, Traversing the
        tree will need to be carefully done  so as not to use those nodes

        See changes in BinarySearchTree and TreeNode
        Note that there are still errors so the programs cannot be checked
