        Binary Search Trees
            a very versatile data structure
            fast to insert/delete and to search items within it
            all three have a time of O(logn)

        Compare sorted and linked list
            Sorted
                search Fast (O(logn))
                Insert slow (O(n))
                Delete slow (O(n))
            Linked list
                Search slow (O(n))
                Insert Fast(O(1)) at the head
                Delete Fast (O(1))

        Tree Data structure
            nodes: contain Data and other than the root node has one edge running upwards to another node
            Edges: what the nodes are connected by
            Root Node: node at the top of the tree
            Parent Node: node above connected nodes
            Child nodes: nodes that branch off from the parent nodes
            Leaf Node: node that has no children
