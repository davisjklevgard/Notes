    This video is used to describe how a bubble sort algorithm sorts through an array of data.
    Here is how a bubble sort algorithm works:
        using a list of 5 numbers, the algorithm looks at the first 2
        if the first one is higher than the second, the two numbers will be switched
        This repeats down the line till the highest number is at the end of the list
        Then the algorithm starts at the beginning of the list and repeats the process till the list is sorted.
