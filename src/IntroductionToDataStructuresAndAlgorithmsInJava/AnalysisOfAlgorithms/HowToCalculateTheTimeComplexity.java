    /*
        Understanding time complexity of an algorithm means to understand how the time of an algorithm varies with the
        size of the input data
        an algorithm will run faster with a small amount of data but the growth of data will affect the time an algorithm
        takes to process that data.
        this is called ORDER OF GROWTH OF AN ALGORITHM, it is also called Asymptotic Analysis
        so this can compares two algorithms; algorithm 1 grows with each increase in data linearly, algorithm 2 grows
        quadratically.
        This would show that algorithm 1 is a better choice to use for large data,
        This comparision is onl;y used for large data, small data sizes are not used
