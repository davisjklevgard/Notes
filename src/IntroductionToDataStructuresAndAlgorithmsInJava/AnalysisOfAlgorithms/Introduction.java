    Analysis of Algorithms
        Space Complexity
            deals with how much space it takes to store data in memory
            since memory has become cheap, we no longer worry about how much it is to store data

        Time Complexity
            how much time it takes for an algorithm to run
            what is usually focused on for algorithms
            algorithm speed can be affected by multiple conditions: different machines (phone vs computer) or by
            environment (hot day vs cold day)
            best way is to remove the complexity of environmental factors
