        Three Types of analysis:
            Worst Case: Most used
            Best Case: usually is not cared about
            Average Case: usually complex; not talked about in this course.

        RAM Model of Computation
            Assumptions on how the operations are performed on the data.
                1. Infinite memory
                    a. dont worry about memory constraints
                2.  Each operation takes one unit of time
                    a. does not matter if mathematical or any other
                    a. read the data in a slot = one step
                    b. move data to a slot = one step
                3. All data is stored in the RAM
                    a. might not be, but we assume it is.
