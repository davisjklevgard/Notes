    Why Algorithms
        gives an idea of running time
            helps break down problems into relevant pieces
        Helps decide on hardware requirements
            if you need a CPU with more power or if a cheaper CPU can be used
        What is feasible vs what is impossible
        Improvement
            learn on how to improve the used al;gorithm or have an entire new one to solve the problem.
    Why Data Structures
        How we store data
        The way we store data helps with the ease of getting the data and saving the data
            library example
                store books in piles or on racks
                then are they stored in an order or haphazardly.
