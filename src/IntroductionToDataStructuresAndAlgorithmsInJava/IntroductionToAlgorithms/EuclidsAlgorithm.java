        Algorithm
            A set of rules that give a sequence of operations for solving a specific type of problem. - Don Knuth
            So an algorithm is a list of instructions for any computer to complete a given task. The more complex the
            computer, the more and difficult the tasks can be,

        Euclid's Algorithm:
            Used to find the GCD (greatest common denominator) of two positive integers
                       m / n with the remainder being r
                       if r = 0, n is the GCD
                       m = n, n = r, and repeat
            This is a recursive algorithm as it calls itself over and over again.

        An algorithm must be exact
