        so if you have a linked list (1 4 7 9) and you want to put in a new node (5) you would need to connect the
        next node reference of the new node to the existing head element of the linked list. This will prevent the loss
        of the existing list and will put the new node at the start of the list.
        To insert a new head takes O(1) time, so there is no need to worry about the size of the array
