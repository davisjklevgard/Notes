        Three N^2 algorithms
            Bubble sort
                Most Inefficient algorithm
                never used in real programs
            Selection Sort
                Better than bubble sort
                Running time is independent of ordering of elements
                The steps will be the same even if the array is sorted or not
            Insertion Sort
                Relatively good for small lists
                Can be used with other sorting algorithms to make it more efficient
                Used in the shell sort algorithm
                Quite fast when the array or list is nearly sorted
