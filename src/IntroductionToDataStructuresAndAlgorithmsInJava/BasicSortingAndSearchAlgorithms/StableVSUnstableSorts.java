        Stable sort
            the order of the elements in which they occurred in a list or edits is maintained even after the sort
        Unstable sort
            the order is not maintained,
        THis occurs if there are say two elements that are the same in an array
        take this list: 5 3 2 1  5. 8 10

        Stable
            1 2 3 5 5. 8 10
        Unstable
            1 2 3 5. 5 8 10

        If one is to write the insertion sort algorithm in a way so that the part that moves the number is not equal to
        but just greater than, the list will be a stable list
