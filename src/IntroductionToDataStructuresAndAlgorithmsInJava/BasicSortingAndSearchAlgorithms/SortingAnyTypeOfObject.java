        You can make an insertion sorting class and have it so that it can sort multiple different arrays, not just
        integers.

        Java provides a way to handle the sorting without needing multiple algorithms. THis is called generics and has
        more to do with Java than data structures and algorithms

        This will not be explained in this course
