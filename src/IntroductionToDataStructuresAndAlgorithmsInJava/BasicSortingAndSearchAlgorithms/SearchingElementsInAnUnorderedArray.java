        Accessing an array element through the index is very fast. It is not dependent on size of the array. That is a
        constant time operation
        Written as O(1)

        Finding an element in an unordered array can be difficult as it could be the last element or not in the array at
        all

        The time it takes then will be proportional to the array size.
         Worst case is O(n)
         deleting an item O(n)
