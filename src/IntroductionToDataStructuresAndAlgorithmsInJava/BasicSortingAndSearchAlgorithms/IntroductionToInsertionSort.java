        Insertion Sort
            a N^2 type algorithm
            it would be taking a new number and placing it in a correct spot in an array
            So you take an already given number or sorted list of numbers and you get a new number.
            You compare it to the top number, if it is smaller the top number is moved down and the compared number
            takes its place. But ifd the new number is larger it goes on top. Now if there are more numbers, then the
            new number is compared to the next number. The algorithm repeats everything till the list is sorted.
