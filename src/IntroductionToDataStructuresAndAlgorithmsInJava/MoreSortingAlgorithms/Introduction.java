        Worst case algorithms take order of n^2 to sort data the size of n
        Merge sort improves the time to n log n
            for a general unordered set of data these algorithms are the best for sorting
            but for constant factors are high in merge sort, it does not work well in small sets of data.

        Other Sorting Algorithms
            Quick Sort
                based on recursion techniques
            Shell Sort
                an improved version of insertion sort
            Linear time algorithms
                Counting Sort
                Radix Sort
                Bucket Sort
                These work for specific kinds of data and not for any general data array
