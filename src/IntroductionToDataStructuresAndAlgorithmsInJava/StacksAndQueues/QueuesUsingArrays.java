        This video shows how an array is used for a queue with enqueue dequeue
        See Queues for a full example with code

        finding if there are any empty slots that can be used
            Math.abs(Tail Index - Head Index) < Length of Array
            so if the value from subtracting the indexes is less than the arrays then there is space in the queue

        Circular queue
            a queue in which yu would enqueue elements by bringing the tail to the zeroth index after the max index has
            been reached
