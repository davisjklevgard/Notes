    /*
        Data collection can be ordered or unordered
            Ordered: data is kept in the order that you put them in
            Unordered: the order is up to the compiler in the runtime.
        Array: simplest way to store data, has limitations
            indexes start at 0
            cannot be resized after they have been created
            all items must be the same type.

            int[] example1 = {3, 4, 5};
            String[2] example2 = {"String", "Array"};

            initializing an already made array can go like so:
            ClothingItem[] items = new ClothingItems[3];
            items[0] = new ClothingItem("Pants", "32", 15);
            items[1] = new ClothingItem("Hat", "M", 15);
            item[2] = new ClothingItem("Shirt", "L", 15);

            making a copy:
            ClothingItem[] copy = Arrays.copyOf(items, items.length); for same length
