      Local variable: variable declared within a method
      Instance variable: variable declared in a class but not in a method

      After creating a variable, you can got to the code tab, click generate.
      There will be a list to choose from where you can chose Getter and setter methods that
      IntelliJ will make.

      "this" is used to help identify different variables
      private int total;

      public static getTotal(int total){
        this.total = total
      So this.tool will stand for the variable that belongs current instance of this class
      the one without this stands for the parameter or argument.
