        A method is a piece of code that you can use and reuse, from many places
        within your application.
        Required:
        a return type
            main method has void, but can use: String int double
        an access modifier
            public, protected. and private determine the visibility of the method to the app.
                public: can be called anywhere
                private: only visible in the class; extends to nested classes
                protected: can be called only in the sub-classes and in the same package through the class it is defined in
        Static Method
            means that the method can be called directly from the class with no need to create an instance of that class.
        Instance Method
            can onl;y be called from an instance of a class (an object)
        Refactor
            highlight code that you wish to put into a new method, go to refactor, move down to extract, and go down
            that menu to method. IntelliJ will make a new method and suggest a name.
