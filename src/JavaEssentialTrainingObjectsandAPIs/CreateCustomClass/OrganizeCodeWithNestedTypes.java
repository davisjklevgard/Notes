    /*
        making code nested in other files can condense code to where it will only be used in and easier to find.

        When commenting out an entire file, there will be an icon to show that it is an unused file

        Make sure to fix any errors that may come up from moving code around.

        make sure to reference the entire hierarchy: the parent class, the nested or member class, and the value.

        Intention action: Alt Enter or Option and Return and put in static import, Then you will only need the value

        import static com.example.java.utilities.MathHelper.Operation.*; (The * imports all values in)
        int input = helper.doMath("Enter a number: ", SUBTRACT);
     */
}
