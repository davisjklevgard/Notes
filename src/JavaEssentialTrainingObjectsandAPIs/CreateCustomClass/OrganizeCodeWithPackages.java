    Package:
        is a description of where a class is in the application, and a location on the file system.

    You can create packages in IntelliJ and make code that is specific for you.
    a class that is moved into its own custom package is not in the same package as its previous main
    class. Access modifier needs to be changed to public

    THere is no thing such as package hierarchy. SO a root package does not have access to a subpackage
