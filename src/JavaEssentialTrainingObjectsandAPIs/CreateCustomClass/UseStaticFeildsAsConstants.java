        A constant is a value that get set once and never changes.
        marked with static and final
        Static: a variable belongs to the class definition and not to an instance of the class
        final as a keyword means that the value can only be set once.

        typing psfs will make public static final String

        a constant name is always uppercase

        a Constant is an Identifier; so you cant misspell the name of the operation
