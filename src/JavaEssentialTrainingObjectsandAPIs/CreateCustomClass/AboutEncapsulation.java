        Packaging of complex functionality in classes
            beginners tend to put all their code into one place
            large programs make this practice hard to read and understand

        Break up larger application into smaller pieces
            Break into individual classes
            use logic for these classes
            each class does its own part

        EX: A toaster has a lot of machinery built within it, so being asked to know the entire process of a toaster
        is a difficult choir. You dont need to know each individual part and what it does to know that the toaster warms
        bread and makes it crispier.


        A development team may only need you to work on one method,
        the rest of the team works on the others.
        You can work on a specific part of the program and others will be able to make code for different parts of the
        program
