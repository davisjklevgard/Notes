    Classes can be accessed through the entire application, if it is public.
    No access modifier for a method means that the method is available for the class
    and other classes in the same package

    Dimmed out identifiers mean that the code is not being used anywhere.

    to call a method in another class; type the class name, then a period and then the method.
    EX: String input = InputHelper.getInput("Enter value 1: ");
        This allows you to use the Scanner class that is in the InputHelper and you dont need to have that
        particular class in the main code.

    One can go to the Code tab in IntelliJ, scroll to optimize imports and if there are any imports that are
    not be used by the program, they will be deleted
