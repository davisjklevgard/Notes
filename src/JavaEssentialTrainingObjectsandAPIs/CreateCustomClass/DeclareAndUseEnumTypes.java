        Enum: short for enumeration
            lets you define a set of values, mutually exclusive, that can be referenced through an application
            can only be defined once, and cant be changed.
            stored as integer values

            chosen during the beginning when you make something new, dont choose class choose enum

            This allows you to have an array that can be used throughout your program.
            It can also make your program easier to use as it has set the values and you just need to reference the
            array.
            See Test
