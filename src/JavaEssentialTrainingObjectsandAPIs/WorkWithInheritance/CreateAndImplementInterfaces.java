        Interface: defines a set of methods with particular signatures, essentially a contract. it is a guarantee that
        those methods can be used.
        WHen defining methods in the interface, you dont add implementing code.
        Abstract Methods: methods that dont have any implementation, but justify what they are supposed to do, not how.
        dont need access modifiers as well

        EX: public class ClothingItem implements Product

        So there is a class of shirts and pants. they both implement product but will return different sizes and prices.
