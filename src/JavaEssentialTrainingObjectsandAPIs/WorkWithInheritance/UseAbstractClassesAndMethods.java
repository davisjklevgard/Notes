        you can choose between interface and abstract lass in object-oriented programming
        An abstract class cannot be instantiated directly
        An abstract class behaves a lot like an interface, but allows a combination of abstract methods and
        concrete methods for more flexibility in designing the application
        You mark a class abstract with the abstract keyword
            public abstract class Example

        Abstract methods: just like a method in an interface, does not have implementation.
            public abstract String exampleMethod;
        Will need to be implemented in the subclasses
